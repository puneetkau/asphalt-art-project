# Unit 1 - Asphalt Art

## Introduction

Cities use asphalt art to improve public safety, inspire their residents and visitors, and brighten communities. Your goal is to create asphalt art to revitalize The Neighborhood and bring the community together with the help of the Painter.

## Requirements

Use your knowledge of object-oriented programming, algorithms, the problem solving process, and decomposition strategies to create asphalt art:
- **Create a new subclass** – Create at least one new subclass of the PainterPlus class that is used for a component of the asphalt art design.
- **Plan an algorithm** – Use the problem solving process and decomposition strategies to plan an algorithm that incorporates a combination of sequencing, selection, and/or iteration.
- **Write a method** – Write at least one method in a PainterPlus subclass that contributes to a component of the asphalt art design.
- **Document your code** – Use comments to explain the purpose of the methods and code segments.

## Notes: Neighborhood & Painter Class

This project was created on Code.org's JavaLab platform using the built in Neightborhood GUI output. To test and edit this project you must build in Code.org's JavaLab with the Neighborhood GUI enabled. For reference to the Painter class documentation, [you can read more here.](https://studio.code.org/docs/ide/javalab/classes/Painter)

## Reflection

1. Describe your project.

   - I created a Minecraft creeper. I thought it would be a good idea because I like Minecraft and the game is already pixilated, making it easier to transfer onto the 12x12 grid. I did this using methods that made the eyes and mouth, as well as one that spread out random spots of dark green for more detail.

2. What are two things about your project that you are proud of?

   I'm proud of my paintDetails methods because it took me a long time to figure out how to check for what color my painter was on. I created a kind of String variable that held the color. I realized in the end that it wasn't working because I capitalized the "G" in "Green."

3. Describe something you would improve or do differently if you had an opportunity to change something about your project.

   - I would have tried to create a method that could reflect what my painter did from one side to the other. I think this would be helpful, even in future projects, as it would reduce the amount of code in half. I'd also maybe choose a different grid as I feel there's an awkward space above the creeper's head. Even though I did it right, it would probably be less awkward on another one.
